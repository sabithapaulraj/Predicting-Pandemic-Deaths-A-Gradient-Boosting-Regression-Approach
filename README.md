# Predicting-Pandemic-Deaths-A-Gradient-Boosting-Regression-Approach


## Description:
This project aims to predict the number of deaths during widespread pandemics, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic in India from January 2020 to August 2021. Utilizing advanced AI/ML techniques, particularly Gradient Boosting Regression, the project develops predictive models to aid resource allocation and healthcare planning during crises.

## Key Features:

### Dataset: 
Historical COVID-19 data including cases, recoveries, and deaths across Indian states/union territories.

### Methodology:
Extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Evaluation Metric: 
Modified Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MMAPE) prioritizing accurate death predictions for effective resource management.

### Models Explored: 
Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.

### Final Model:
Gradient Boosting Regression with polynomial features and optimized hyperparameters.

### Performance:
Achieved minimal errors with an MMAPE of 4705 on the test dataset, showcasing the model's effectiveness.



## Architecture:
The choice of Gradient Boosting Regressor is attributed to its ability to handle complex, non-linear data relationships, and robustness against overfitting. By combining weak learners iteratively, it forms a strong predictive model, facilitating precise predictions essential for healthcare resource planning.
