# Predicting-Pandemic-Deaths-A-Gradient-Boosting-Regression-Approach


## Description:
This project aims to predict the number of deaths during widespread pandemics, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic in India from January 2020 to August 2021. Utilizing advanced AI/ML techniques, particularly Gradient Boosting Regression, the project develops predictive models to aid resource allocation and healthcare planning during crises.

## Key Features:

Dataset: Historical COVID-19 data including cases, recoveries, and deaths across Indian states/union territories.
Methodology: Extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation Metric: Modified Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MMAPE) prioritizing accurate death predictions for effective resource management.
Models Explored: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.
Final Model: Gradient Boosting Regression with polynomial features and optimized hyperparameters.
Performance: Achieved minimal errors with an MMAPE of 4705 on the test dataset, showcasing the model's effectiveness.
Architecture:
The choice of Gradient Boosting Regressor is attributed to its ability to handle complex, non-linear data relationships, and robustness against overfitting. By combining weak learners iteratively, it forms a strong predictive model, facilitating precise predictions essential for healthcare resource planning.

## Results:
The final model demonstrated strong predictive capability with minimal errors, showcasing its effectiveness in forecasting pandemic-related deaths. Key variables like date, population density, confirmed cases, and cured cases played crucial roles in predictions, aiding in resource allocation and planning.
